    "# What are Neural Networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks, in a single line, attempt to iteratively train a set (or sets) of weights that, when used together, return the most accurate predictions for a set of inputs. Just like many of our past models, the model is trained using a loss function, which our model will attempt to minimize over iterations. Remember that a loss function is some function that takes in our predictions and the actual values and returns some sort of aggregate value that shows how accurate (or not) we were.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks do this by establishing sets of neurons (known as hidden layers) that take in some sort of input(s), apply a weight, and pass that output onward. As we feed more data into the network, it adjusts those weights based on the output of the loss function, until we have highly trained and specific weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does one neuron turn out one way and a second neuron another? That's not generally something we can understand (though attempts have been made, such as Google's [Deep Dream](https://deepdreamgenerator.com/)). You can understand this as a kind of (very advanced) mathematic optimization.\n",

    "\n",
    "Today, we're going to discuss some of the theory behind Neural Networks, particularly around the topology (the shape) of the network and how we iteratively fit the weights in the network to the data we've seen. We'll also write and investigate a (very small) neural network written using Python and Numpy. The next few days will take us through different types of networks and how we can create them using popular libraries like Keras and Tensorflow."

This means that the neuron is activated when its output is positive and not activated otherwise. This has the intuitive effect of turning a neuron \"on\" in certain cases and off in other cases.\n",

More than being impractical, for larger models with many weights and many possible values, we may still be estimating the \"best\" weights long past the [heat death of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe). \n",

The derivative (the rate of change in the function for a small change in the inputs) of a function at a given point tells which direction we would like to change our weights. We'll make changes of a certain size in the right direction until we hit a place where the derivative is zero (i.e., either direction will increase the output of the function) and will consider that our \"best\" place. \n",

For networks with lots of hidden layers, earlier layers train at a much slower rate than layers closer to the output (the gradient \"vanishes\" as it gets deeper into the network, so the weights cannot change as much).
