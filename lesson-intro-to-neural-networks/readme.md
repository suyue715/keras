# Intro to Neural Networks

After this lesson, you will should be able to:

- Identify the difference between a single layer and multi-layer perceptron
- Define epoch, learning rate, activation function, hidden layer, neuron, weights, and bias term
- Define forward and backward propogation
- Discuss overfitting in neural networks and how we avoid it
